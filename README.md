# Time Series Analysis of S&P 500

## Project Overview

This project explores the time series analysis of the S&P 500 index, with a detailed focus on four major companies: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG). The analysis includes data collection, stock price analysis, specific observation of Apple's closing price changes, resampling analysis, and a multivariate analysis to understand correlations among the selected stocks.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather historical stock data for the S&P 500 index, specifically focusing on Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG).
   - Ensure data integrity by cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, addressing any missing values or inconsistencies.

2. **Stock Price Analysis**
   - Analyze historical stock prices for the selected companies to identify trends and patterns.
   - Examine the overall market performance through the lens of these key stocks.

3. **Observation of Closing Price Change (Apple Case Study)**
   - Focus specifically on the closing price changes of Apple (AAPL).
   - Analyze daily percentage changes to study volatility and market reactions, providing a case study on Apple's stock.

4. **Resampling Analysis of the Closing Price**
   - Conduct resampling of the closing price data at different frequencies (e.g., weekly, monthly) for all selected companies.
   - Evaluate trends and seasonal patterns across different time scales.

5. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Perform a multivariate analysis to explore correlations between the closing prices, trading volumes, and other relevant financial metrics of the selected stocks.
   - Utilize statistical methods and visualizations to identify interdependencies among the stocks.
